# Java-Share-Trading-Account
This project implements a D-MAT (Dematerialized) account for equity shares and transaction details regarding the same shares. The program allows users to create an account, log in, manage their profile, buy or sell shares, and generate transaction reports.

                                                             Features
                                                             
Create a Demat account with needed details such as user name, account number, money in the account, share name or ID, number of shares held, and value of each share.
Log in with account number (integer value).
Approve or reject classifieds, activate or deactivate users, add or remove classifieds, manage type/categories of classifieds, and generate various reports as an administrator.
Manage own profile, post a classified, view all classifieds, connect with other users to perform sell or buy, and integrate payment options as a user.
Display demat account details, deposit money, withdraw money, buy transaction, sell transaction, and view transaction report from the main menu.

                                                              Details
                                                              
Each share transaction should contain the date & time the share was bought or sold, the number of shares that were transacted, and the price at which it was bought or sold.
Money in the account should be adjusted based on the transactions, including a transaction charge of 0.5% (for both buying and selling) on the transacted value, with a minimum transaction charge of Rs. 100.
A STT (Securities Transfer Tax) of 0.1% of the overall transaction (not including the transaction charges) will be deducted.
The transaction charges and taxation percentage should be easily configurable.

                                                               Usage
                                                               
To use the program, run the Java application and select from the main menu. Follow the prompts to create an account, log in, manage profiles, or perform transactions.
